# Airline-Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis
The purpose of this project was to utilize customer flight data to determine drivers that influence the satisfaction level of airline clientele with the aim of increasing overall customer satisfaction. The provided flight data came in the form of customer surveys that included each customer’s rating of their experience along with various other variables pertaining to the customer’s demographics, behavior, history and specific flight information. Through analysis and data modelling, we were able to identify the variables that were most consistently correlated with customer satisfaction so that these areas could be a source of focus during the implementation of new policies aimed at improving the overall customer experience.
